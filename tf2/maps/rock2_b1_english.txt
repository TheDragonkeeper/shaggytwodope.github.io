Objective:
Your team must steal the other teams intel that is located in their warden's office and take it to THEIR gas chamber.
Once a team scores, gas will be released throughout the bases. Players must find the designated gasmask stations throughout the bases and grab a gasmask to avoid being affected by the gas. You can also enter the water to be safe from the gas as well.

Other Notes:
A team can open an alternate route under the yard by blowing up
the barricades in the underground tunnels.
