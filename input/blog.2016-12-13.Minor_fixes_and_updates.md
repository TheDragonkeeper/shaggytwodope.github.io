So I've been hacking away at slowly refining the site. While nothing major has come along, I'm happy with how the site works for now. If anyone ever comes across a bug.. let me know.

I've been updating my repo for the few things I package. It's really fun to see how stuff like [drive][drivelink] and [buku][bukulink] get used by people. I think about 200-300 people make sure of most tools I've put up PPA's or Debian repo's for. Not to mention my 100+ packages on Archlinux's AUR.

I plan to find some time on occasion to update my tiny site with some content. Ignoring failed relationships and terrible jobs that didn't work out very well.
