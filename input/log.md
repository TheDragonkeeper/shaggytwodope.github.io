This page simply serves to write down ideas or issues related
to some of the packages I maintain.

# Alarm-clock
* 1.4.5: This release was merely to update upstream url. And
new author info.
* 1.4.4: Big update fixing a few large issues. Mostly dropping
gstreamer0.10 and solving some glib and general compiling issues.

# Drive
* 0.3.9.1-2: Update to rebuild against new boltdb. Fixes many issues
reported on github.
* 0.3.9.1: Small update to test rebuilding against 1.7 golang.
* 0.3.9: Standard update.
* 0.3.8.1: I decided to package the Debian and Ubuntu PPA to ease the
questions and emails from people. Despite the release being minor and
only related to self installation for users.
* 0.3.8: This was the first release done entirely from my Archlinux
install. No longer requiring a vm to ship a new release.
However testing is required for any Debian/PPA package.
