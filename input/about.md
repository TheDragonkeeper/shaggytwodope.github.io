## About

I've been an opensource and Linux enthusiast for many years.
I love information and the process of learning how things work.
You'll find me trying to find a commandline solution to almost all
types of simple or complex software when possible.

Here is my [pubkey.asc][pubkeylink]. If your not aware of gpg, then check it out [here][gnupglink].
If you want to contact me in a serious way, or just be safer about how
you send information online. Using gpg is the ideal way to do so.

I have a number of addresses you can use to send me mail. Feel free to contact me via
twodopeshaggy@gmail.com, shaggytwodope@teknik.io and shaggytwodope@riseup.net.
But if you know how to contact me by any other means, I won't stop you.

## Places you can find me

* [twitter][twitterlink] Everyone likes 140 chars or less.
* [keybase][keybaselink] GPG made friendly.
* [ello][ellolink] Say ello to me.
* [reddit][redditlink] Front page of the internet.
* [launchpad][launchpadlink] Packages for Ubuntu.
* [github][githublink] Give me a good pull.
